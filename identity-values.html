     <h3>Personal Values</h3>
       <p>After taking a personality test I came back with the 'Advocate (INFJ-A)' personality, which both strengths and weaknesses rang true, like the below quote.</p>
       <p><em>“Idealistic and principled, they aren't content to coast through life - they want to stand up and make a difference. For Advocate personalities, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world.”</em></p>
       <p>I have always been operating in an area that is doing social good. Probably the initial reason I was a teacher, and then went into environmental work, and more recently working at Banqer - which is a financial literacy education company.
       I have always been told that I have a very strong moral compass and I have a real sense of what is right and wrong. I have never been able to stay in a situation for too long that did not sit well with me. </p>
       <p>This played out in my last role where I helped to start a company but the founder started to make 
       some questionable and borderline exploitative decisions. This resulted in me facing a somewhat ethical situation and after trying to speak out and raise concerns the situation turned toxic (as they tend to do to people who speak out) and I had to leave everything I had helped to build behind as I could not work and comply with things I disagreed whole-heartedly with. </p>   
       <p>In saying that I am also a very understanding person and understand that nothing is black and white and situations are complex and people are only human, a skill which definatley helped me when teaching high school and dealing with teenagers. </p>
       
      <p>In terms of how my culture has impacted my values, I think my parents have influenced this strongly. My dad has a strong moral compass and physically cannot stay quiet when something seems unjust. My mother on the other hand is more calm and collected and is the sort to quietly take stands in the background and work to fight injustice - probably why she is a lawyer. 
       I do also come from a line of incredible women who were in many instances doing things that weren't expected of women in their times.</p>

       <p><h3>Strengths and weaknesses</h3>
       My strengths are that I am very good with time management. I am good at creating plans and following them, 
       I'm good at getting things done. I am a competent learner and produce a high quality of work. 
       As I was a teacher I'm used to reading information and then being able to teach it - which betters my own understanding. 
       My limitations are as I have high expectations, when I don't meet them it can be devastating.
        This is 100% my biggest weakness. Although I am VERY open to improving on this because it's honestly such a drag.
       So throughout my time with Dev Academy when I  get knocked back I will try to remind myself that it is not the end of the world.</p>

       <p><h3>Strategies used when dealing with resistance or tension</h3>
       I think I am pretty good at this. I have had to deal with this alot as a teacher, and also a short stint as an over the phone debt collector. 
       I find the bext things to do are to hear the person out. Understand the problem from both sides and understand what the outcome is that the other person wants and why they want it like that. 
       I think explaining the situation transparently helps and then you can work together to find a solution that suits all parties.
