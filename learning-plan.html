<div class="learing-plan">
        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        My long term goal is to have a stable career in an area that I enjoy. I want a career that doesn't drain me but that I enjoy enough and still have energy outside of work to do the things I love. 

        <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        My strengths are that I am good with time management. I can focus and work hard. And I was a teacher so know how to simplify concepts. Limitations are that I can be too hard on myself and can be a bit of a perfectionist which can block me at times.

       <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3> 
        I am looking forward to the opportunity to really use the 'Not yet' mindset. And allowing myself to not be perfect and just enjoy the journey. Not expecting myself to be perfect the first (or second, or third) time I try something. 
        
       <h3> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3> 
       At the moment I am still working part time so am being pro-active and starting the next sprint on Sunday 
       (even just an hour or so). So that I don't start the week feeling behind and then have more time to work with if I do get behind. I am also using check box lists to help me stay on top of things. 
       Going forward I will continued to pre-prepare my following days or weeks work so that I am aware of what I need to do to stay on top of things.  
        
       <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3> 
        Take a break. Communicate. 
        I will talk with my support network, ask discord for help, ask Jatin. 

       <h3> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        I will ask discord when I need help solving a problem if I cannot solve it myself within 10-15 min. 
        
       <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3> 
        I expect them to be understading and patient with querries. Even if its a repeated question or problem. 

        <h3>Any scheduling information</h3>
        I don't really have any of these however I do on occassion help look after my neice on a Thursday or Friday if there are emergency child care situations (my brother is seperated so it can be difficult at times). I don't expect to be called on but to help be prepared in case I will always try to get through the larger chunk of my week at the start of the week. I am very good at not procrastinating so this shouldn't be an issue.
