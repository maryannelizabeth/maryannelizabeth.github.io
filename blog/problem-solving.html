        <h3>Being blocked</h3>
        <p>There were a few times this sprint were I was blocked, although I personally wouldn't have called them 'simple problems'. All of them bottled down to the issue of me not understanding where or how to use a particular JS tool. 
          To help me problem solve I would read the error message, re-read my code, play around with it here and there to see if anything changed, do a general google serach and look on MDN, watch a YouTube video about the thing I was trying to do,
        search in the discord chat to see if someone else has already had this issue and then finally reach out to a facillitator and ask for a call. I felt constantly confused and overwhelmed knowing how much I don't know. I took comfort in the fact that
      at least I was able to do some of the tasks and that I could understand the logic of the solution when it was explained. I learnt that JavaScript is hard, and will continue to be hard, even when I have finished DevAcademy. </p>

      <h3>Solving a problem</h3>
      <p>I don't know if I would say I 'elegantly' solved a problem. All my problems were solved by trial and error. Although the closest thing to elegantly solving a problem would be in the Manipulating Objects section where we had 
        to assing the spouse of one person as the other. It was a bit complicated as the thing you want to do is to change the 
        original code, but by trying some stuff and reading the error messages I was able to solve these problems pretty quickly.
       It felt pretty good doing this as I felt like I was beginning to understand certain things. </p>

        <h3>Using Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
        <p>Pseudocode: I feel not super confident in this. In some ways I've been using it by thinking about what I should do but not actually writing it down, this is something I should probably try and get used to.</p>
        <p>Trying Something: I feel confident in this because it is literally all I can do. I feel like I'm mostly just swinging in the dark - if something doesn't work I change the brackets around it, i change the input data or something totally random and see what happnes - usually it still doesn't work, but like 2% of the time it does. </p>
        <p>Rubber Ducky Method: I personally love this method, but have not yet utilised it. Probably because where I am at right now I do genuinely need help from something that can talk back to me. </p>
        <p>Reading error messages: This is somewhat helpful to me as sometimes I can fix it, most the time I can't but I can at least work out where the error is happening. </p>
        <p>Console.logging: This one I have gotten more used to. I kind of didnt understand the point of it to begin with but am getting more used to using it to check earlier elements in my code. </p>
        <p>Googling: Very confident in googeling. I have a history degree so feel like my research skills are pretty good. That's not to say that when I find useful information I know what to do with it though!</p>
        <p>Asking peers for help: Not so confident at this point, although getting a bit better now that I am beginning to get to know some people.</p>
        <p>Asking coaches: I had a real uptick in this practise this week. I found it really useful to have concepts walked through so will definitely continue to ask for help - even if I feel like I am just being a bother!</p>
        <p>Reflecting: I am somewhat okay with this, but I think it is something I will try more of.</p>
