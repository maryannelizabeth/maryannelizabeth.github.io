  <h1>Bootcamp week Two reflection on learning plan</h1>
  <h3>For original learning plan see below</h3>
  <p>Now that I am two weeks into bootcamp I thought it was a good time to reflect on my learning plan.</p>
  <p>For the most part it is relatively the same, but now that I know a little bit more about what is happening in bootcamp and how I am going
    both with the workload and with the mindset I am going to tweak some things. Firstly I am suprised at how well
    I am doing mentally and in terms of being my own worst critic as stated in my learning plan below that is my 
    biggest weakness. I also thought I would struggle when I found out that we don't actually finish all the tasks, but 
    I have really leaned into seeing the process of learning as the success, not the completion of tasks as the 
    success - I plan to keep this in mind going forward. And for the next wee while focus on just learning, not completing. In a more practical sense 
    I am also hoping to spend a few more hours on coding. I plan on having a tech in this week to get some advice around that.

  <h1>BootCamp Learning Plan</h1>
  <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
  <p>My career plan is the same as it was at the start of foundations <em>"My long term goal is to have a stable career in an area that I enjoy. I want a career that doesn't drain me but that I enjoy enough and still have energy outside of work to do the things I love. "</em></p>

  <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
 <p>My biggest stregth is that I am not a time waster. I don't stuggle with procrastinating and I like to get things done with time to spare so plan accordingly. I will also be pretty good at treating bootcamp like a full time job.</p>
 <p>My biggest limitation will be my own inner critic, and feeling like I'm not good enough throughout and this will be my biggest non-technical challenge at BootCamp. </p> 
 <hr>
  <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
  <p>Continuing on with what I said in my foundations learing plan - re pushing past that inner critic and also learning to consistenently take feedback well and in a constructive way.</p>
  
  <hr>
  <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
  <p>My expectations of the Bootcamp team are that they will be friendly, patient and approachable. Basically a safe place to be vulnerable when things are getting hard.</p>
  
  <hr>
  <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
  <p>I expect that I will struggle a lot. But I also expect that I will keep going, and keep reminding myself that it's okay to suck - sucking at something is the start of being kinda good at something. </p>

<h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        My long term goal is to have a stable career in an area that I enjoy. I want a career that doesn't drain me but that I enjoy enough and still have energy outside of work to do the things I love. 

        <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        My strengths are that I am good with time management. I can focus and work hard. And I was a teacher so know how to simplify concepts. Limitations are that I can be too hard on myself and can be a bit of a perfectionist which can block me at times.

       <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3> 
        I am looking forward to the opportunity to really use the 'Not yet' mindset. And allowing myself to not be perfect and just enjoy the journey. Not expecting myself to be perfect the first (or second, or third) time I try something. 
        
       <h3> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3> 
       At the moment I am still working part time so am being pro-active and starting the next sprint on Sunday 
       (even just an hour or so). So that I don't start the week feeling behind and then have more time to work with if I do get behind. I am also using check box lists to help me stay on top of things. 
       Going forward I will continued to pre-prepare my following days or weeks work so that I am aware of what I need to do to stay on top of things.  
        
       <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3> 
        Take a break. Communicate. 
        I will talk with my support network, ask discord for help, ask Jatin. 

       <h3> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        I will ask discord when I need help solving a problem if I cannot solve it myself within 10-15 min. 
        
       <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3> 
        I expect them to be understading and patient with querries. Even if its a repeated question or problem. 

        <h3>Any scheduling information</h3>
        I don't really have any of these however I do on occassion help look after my neice on a Thursday or Friday if there are emergency child care situations (my brother is seperated so it can be difficult at times). I don't expect to be called on but to help be prepared in case I will always try to get through the larger chunk of my week at the start of the week. I am very good at not procrastinating so this shouldn't be an issue.
