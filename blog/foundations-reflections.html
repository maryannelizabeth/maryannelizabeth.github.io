<h3>New things learnt about myself and my ego due to the core learning</h3>
<p>During the core learning I realised I am more open to reflection and growth than I have been at previous times in my life. I learnt that when I started to learn to knit that I was really learning a growth mindset. I also learnt about using 'not yet' as a good way to remind myself that it's okay I don't know things 'not yet'.  </p>

<h3>Values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming </h3>
<p>Values, empathy and self-awareness are super important in learning and programming because these are the things that make us human and able to connect and work with one another. Learning and programming is ultimately for humans, so we need to be human when we do these things. </p>

<h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
<p>I think what has suprised me about core learning is how well delivered and supported it is at Dev Academy. It's obvious that it isn't just a ticking the box activity and that students are well supported to develop these skills and to learn in a safe environment.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Challenging aspects of the core learning</h3>
<p>The most challenging aspects were fulling commiting to new mindfulness practises. This is something I alaredy do and feel pretty good at - obviously always more things to do and explore, but at a time when my priority is learning the tech stuff because im weaker at that then sometimes the core stuff was pushed aside. </p>

<h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
<P>I think it is obviously the key thing that sets you apart from other places and that it develops people who are more work ready and ready to continue growing.</P>

<hr>
<h3>Is core learning a waste of time?</h3>
<p>No, I think it is hugely valuable to learn more about yourself and learn to be self aware so that you are able to work at your best and take time off or take things a bit easier when you aren't at your best. </p>
